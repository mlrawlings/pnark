pnark (pronounced [***n√§rk***](https://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/de/0/nark.mp3) - the `p` is silent) is a module that allows you to get insight into what's happening on your server during the lifecycle of a request.

## Basic usage with express

**1.** Add the express middleware and some plugins:
```js
app.use(require('pnark/express').middleware({
  plugins: [require('pnark-http'), require('pnark-fs')]
}));
```

**2.** Visit your page in the browser and click the icon in the bottom right of your screen to view the report
